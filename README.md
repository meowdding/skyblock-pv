# SkyBlock Profile Viewer

A Profile Viewer for Hypixel SkyBlock, developed with love and passion.

The Profile Viewer can be opened with ``/pv`` for your own Profile, or ``/pv <username>`` for someone else.
<br/>You can switch between the tabs using the buttons on the right side of the UI.
<br/>If a tab has multiple categories, you can switch between them using the buttons on the top of the UI.

> [!WARNING]
> The mod is still in development, design is subject to change.
> Visit the [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for a list of features that are planned to be added.

Designed to be simple and to show off the main aspects of the player's profile.
<br/>Designed with a purpose to be screenshot-able and shareable.

...we just didn't put them in the ReadMe. Look at them when pv'ing yourself or someone else!

### Mod Compatibility

- Using [SkyBlockMod](https://github.com/kevinthegreat1/SkyblockMod-Fabric) is completely unsupported, they add their own command shortcuts, which you cant
  disable. They shorten ``/party leave`` to ``pv``, which is the same as our command.
- [SkyBlocker](https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker) add their own Profile Viewer. We override their ``/pv`` command with ours, if you wish to use
  theirs, you can use ``/skyblocker pv``. We don't have an option to disable this behavior since because you're already this mod, its unlikely you want to
  prefer SkyBlocker's Profile Viewer.
