A Profile Viewer for Hypixel SkyBlock, developed with love and passion.

The Profile Viewer can be opened with ``/pv`` for your own Profile, or ``/pv <username>`` for someone else.
<br/>You can switch between the tabs using the buttons on the right side of the UI.
<br/>If a tab has multiple categories, you can switch between them using the buttons on the top of the UI.

### Mod Compatibility

#### SkyBlockMod

- **Issue**: [SkyBlockMod](https://github.com/kevinthegreat1/SkyblockMod-Fabric) is unsupported and introduces command shortcuts. While you can disable these
  shortcuts, doing so disables **all** of them.
- **Conflict**: The mod abbreviates `/party leave` to `pv`, which conflicts with our command.

#### SkyBlocker

- **Issue**: [SkyBlocker](https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker) includes its own Profile Viewer.
- **Resolution**: We override their `/pv` command with ours. If you prefer SkyBlocker's version, use `/skyblocker pv` instead.
- **Note**: We do not provide an option to disable this override, as using our mod implies a preference for our Profile Viewer.
